#### About

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/media/ui_scheme.png"/></div>

```FlowCicerone``` provides different instances of ```Cicerone``` wherever an independent navigation flow is necessary:
activity, flow fragments and flow fragment container.

```FlowRouter``` provides several additional methods for working with subnavigation:
1. Use standart methods for current flow navigation (for example ```router.navigateTo(screen)```).
2. Use overloaded methods for navigation on a specific flow (for example ```router.navigateTo("Tab1", screen)```).
3. Use overloaded methods with empty tag for navigation in activity stack (for example ```router.navigateTo("", screen)```).
4. Use switch command for switch current flow ```router.switch("Tab2")```.
